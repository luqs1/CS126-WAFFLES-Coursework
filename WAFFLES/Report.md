## Data Structures
The most important data structure I've used in this coursework is my `AVLTree` implementation. I also had to build a `Node` implementation as a prerequisite.

### Why not a `HashMap`?

I was contemplating whether to use an `AVLTree` or a `HashMap`; whilst I thought a `HashMap` would be easier to implement giving me more time to work on the Stores, I thought it had some points that needed addressing.

1. Setting the initial size.
2. Rebuilding the internal array once it became too full.

Point 1: HashMaps work best when there's a prime number of array spaces and/ or when we have well defined hashing functions. A combination of both can lead to an amortised O(1) add/ delete which is desirable. However, it is hard to know how many elements will be in a `HashMap` (which is a major factor in deciding initial size) its even harder to calculate a prime number in that vicinity. The second point can be addressed by having a static array of many prime numbers but I still find this solution inelegant.

Point 2: When the HashMap inevitably has to resize, it is important to consider how costly an operation it might be if you want to spread out the previous elements in the new array. It's possible that one can come up with a simplification so that the hash doesn't need to be reapplied to every element but again I find this hasslesome.

### Benefits of `AVLTree`

The amount of human coding time that was required to build the `AVLTree` cannot be understated, and testing to see if it worked adequately was equally challenging. However, it is labor well spent. The `AVLTree` has O(logn) add/ delete and search. Most importantly however, it is consistent, requires no additional rebalancing/ resizing and works in various circumstances.

If I simply used a BST, I'd be gambling on the time complexity. The `AVLTree`'s _self-balancing_ means that it would take longer that if it didnt have to balance itself, but it gurantees performance of O(logn).

### My Implementation
The type of my `AVLTree` is `AVLTree<K extends Comparable<K>, V>`, it also requires a `Function<V, K>` at initialisation. To summarise, I can store non-comparable values with comparable keys, providing I give a function that instructs the Tree how to get the key `K` from the value `V`. With the restriction that `K` is unique relative to the rest of the tree.

For example: `MyAVLTree<Integer, String> customers = new MyAVLTree<>(Customer::getID())` would allow me to store Customers (not comparable) and use their IDs (comparable and unique) as keys. This provides the additional benefit that if I want a `Customer[]` in order of their IDs, i can simply do an `inorder` traversal.

### Sorter
The sorter is a tool to use binary sort on an array. I noticed once again that it would be wasteful to only work on `Comparable` elements or to even insist on only a select way of comparing two elements even if they were `Comparable`. So my sorter would ask for a function `Function<Pair<V>, Integer>` where a `Pair<V>` is just two elements of type `V` (the two being compared). This function works in the same spirit as a comparator and allows me to use comparators on different attributes of whatever I'm sorting. This proved very versatile and was of great aid in implementing the Stores.




## CustomerStore
### Overview
<!-- A short description about what structures/algorithms you have implemented and why you used them. For example: -->
<!-- The template is only a guide, you are free to make any changes, add any bullets points, re-word it entirely, etc. -->
<!-- * <- is a bullet point, you can also use - minuses or + pluses instead -->
<!-- And this is *italic* and this is **bold** -->
<!-- Words in the grave accents, or in programming terms backticks, formats it as code: `put code here` -->
* 
* 
### Space Complexity
<!-- Write here what you think the overall store space complexity is and gives a brief reason why. -->
<!-- <br> gives a line break -->
<!-- In tables, you don't really need the spaces, it only makes it look nice in text form -->
<!-- You can just do "CustomerStore|O(n)|I have used a single `ArrayList` to store customers." -->
Store         | Worst Case | Description
------------- | ---------- | -----------
CustomerStore | O(n)       | I have used a single `ArrayList` to store customers. <br>Where `n` is total customers added.

### Time Complexity
<!-- Tell us the time complexity of each method and give a very short description. -->
<!-- These examples may or may not be correct, these examples have not taken account for other requirements like duplicate IDs and such.  -->
<!-- Again, the template is only a guide, you are free to make any changes. -->
<!-- If you did not do a method, enter a dash "-" -->
<!-- Technically, for the getCustomersContaining(s) average case, you are suppose to do it relative to s -->
<!-- Note, that this is using the original convertToAccents() method -->
<!-- So O(a*s + n*(a*t + t)) -->
<!-- Where a is the amount of accents -->
<!-- Where s is the length of the search term String  -->
<!-- Where t is the average length of a name -->
<!-- Where n is the total number of customers -->
<!-- But you can keep it simple -->

Method                           | Average Case     | Description
-------------------------------- | ---------------- | -----------
addCustomer(Customer c)          | O(1)             | Array add is constant time
addCustomer(Customer[] c)        | O(n)             | Add all customers <br>`n` is the length of the input array
getCustomer(Long id)             | O(n)             | Linear search <br>`n` is total customers in the store
getCustomers()                   | O(n^2)           | BubbleSort <br>`n` is total customers in the store
getCustomers(Customer[] c)       | O(n^2)           | BubbleSort <br>`n` is the length of the input array
getCustomersByName()             | O(n^2)           | BubbleSort <br>`n` is total customers in the store
getCustomersByName(Customer[] c) | -                | -
getCustomersContaining(String s) | O(a + n*(a + b)) | Searches all customers <br>`a` is the average time it takes to convert accents <br>`n` is total customers <br>`b` is average string search time
